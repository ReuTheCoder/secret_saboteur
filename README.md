# Pass n' Play

Orignally just meant to host one game, Secret Saboteur - A social deduction game. Now I hope to update it with more "Social party gameS" when I get the chance.

Secret Sabototeur Description:
Everyone gets the same secret number (1–10).
One player is the Guesser and must figure it out based on other player's accurate clues related to the prompt.
One player is the Saboteur and tries to mislead the guesser.
  
Teammates win if the Guesser is correct or exposes the Saboteur.
The Saboteur wins if they stay hidden and cause a wrong guess.
The Guesser must guess who they think the Saboteur is before guessing the secret number.
